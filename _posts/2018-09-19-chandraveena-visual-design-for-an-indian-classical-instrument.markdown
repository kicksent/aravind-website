  When S. Balachander, an Indian Classical musician and performing artist of the
  one-of-a-kind Chandraveena, offered me a chance to design and build his
  website, I jumped at the opportunity. I had always wanted to do a design
  project and here I would have full control over the design of Balachander's
  website. Balachander has himself designed the Chandraveena, an instrument with
  an amazing visual and sonic personality. I used the Chandraveena instrument as
  the main design inspiration for designing the visual style for the
  Chandraveena website. Read on to know how I did it.

One day at a holiday home, somewhere in the quiet hills of [Panchgani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchgani), [Bala](https://goofy-lewin-6d9bef.netlify.com/about/) and I were sipping some piping hot ginger tea, breathing in deep lungfuls of clean air and chatting. The discussion was wide ranging, covering music, life, career and [responsive design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/)! And why not? You see, while not on holiday, Bala or S. Balachander is an Indian Classical musician and performing artist of a unique instrument called the Chandraveena. Bala designed the Chandraveena himself, in what has been an [amazing journey](https://goofy-lewin-6d9bef.netlify.com/about/) which you should definitely read about. But at the risk of oversimplification, the Chandraveena is also an example of "responsive design" - a musical instrument which can respond to the artist's will, to render the music in as faithful and expressive a manner as possible.

So when Bala offered me a chance to design and build his website, I jumped at the opportunity. For a while, I had wanted to do a design project. And it was hard to resist the prospect of working on a music website whose aim was to narrate the timeless values and philosophy of music and showcase a unique instrument and a musical form. And thus, we got to work.

## Design Process

We started with the content. Before getting into details like fonts, colors or other visual elements, we thought we should establish a clear idea of what the website would communicate. This is not a new approach by any means, and there is no dearth of material advocating "responsive design", "mobile-first design" and "content-first design". But content often exists in a form which we may think we understand, but it still requires effort to present it effectively. For us, by visualising the process of a user visiting the website, we were able to identify what pages we may need, what content those pages may contain and how those pages may help the user in understanding and appreciating the musical journey of the Chandraveena.

After a few discussions, we came up with this framework.



## Visual Elements

Given the amazing visual and sonic personality of the Chandraveena, it was easy to see that it would be our main design inspiration. We started with the colors. In real life, the Chandraveena has a lovely shade of maroon which is quite hard to appreciate from a photograph. We captured its different shades from a number of pictures taken in different lighting conditions, and this is what we got.

With each shade as a base color, we created a light gray, a dark gray and a contrasting shade. I found this tutorial very useful and this website for visualising the palette.

Without choosing anything yet, we moved on to fonts. We wanted a font with some character to be the heading/title font, an easy-to-read font for the main text and an intermediate one for paragraph headings. Bala had a preference for serif fonts as he thought they lent a bit more gravity to the content. We used the tool called Font Joy to see different font pairings.

We found a few candidates and moved to the logo. We wanted the logo to be evocative of the instrument, emphasizing its basic structure and also its flourishes. Bala shared some of his hand drawings which he had used to visualize the instrument when he was getting it fabricated. The swan near the tuning posts represents the scholarship aspect.
