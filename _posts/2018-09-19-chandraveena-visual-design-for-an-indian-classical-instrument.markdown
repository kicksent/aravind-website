excerpt: >-
  When S. Balachander, an Indian Classical musician and performing artist of the
  one-of-a-kind Chandraveena, offered me a chance to design and build his
  website, I jumped at the opportunity. I had always wanted to do a design
  project and here I would have full control over the design of Balachander's
  website. Balachander has himself designed the Chandraveena, an instrument with
  an amazing visual and sonic personality. I used the Chandraveena instrument as
  the main design inspiration for designing the visual style for the
  Chandraveena website. Read on to know how I did it.

One day at a holiday home, somewhere in the quiet hills of [Panchgani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchgani), [Bala](https://goofy-lewin-6d9bef.netlify.com/about/) and I were drinking some piping hot ginger tea, breathing in deep lungfuls of air and chatting. The discussion was wide ranging, covering music, life, career and [responsive design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/)! And why not? You see, while not on holiday, Bala or S. Balachander is an Indian Classical musician and performing artist of a unique instrument called the Chandraveena. Bala designed the Chandraveena himself, in what has been an [amazing journey](https://goofy-lewin-6d9bef.netlify.com/about/) which you should definitely read about. But at the risk of oversimplification, the Chandraveena is also an example of "responsive design" - a musical instrument which can respond to the artist's will, to render the music in as faithful and expressive a manner as possible.

So when Bala offered me a chance to design and build his website, I jumped at the opportunity. For a while, I had wanted to do a design project.
